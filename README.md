## Proposal: Analysis and Prediction of Rice Production using ARIMA and LSTM Models

### Problem Statement
In this challenge, participants are tasked with predicting the production of rice on a state-wise or union territory-wise basis. The dataset provided spans from the agricultural sessions of 2004-2005 to 2022-2023, detailing the quantity of rice produced annually.

### Proposal Overview
The prediction of rice production on a state-wise or union territory-wise basis is vital for agricultural planning and policymaking. In this proposal, we outline our approach to analyze the dataset spanning from 2004-2005 to 2022-2023 and predict rice production using two different models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). Our goal is to derive meaningful insights from the data and provide accurate predictions for the next five years.

### Dataset Analysis
#### Overview
The dataset comprises three distinct tables, each offering insightful perspectives on rice production spanning from 2004-2005 to 2022-2023. Within Table 1 and Table 2, comprehensive state-wise data delineates the intricate nuances of rice production dynamics over the years.

#### Analysis Goals
Our analysis delves deeper to determine the rate of production growth or decline for each state/union territory. By scrutinizing the annual production trends against historical data, we can discern not only the magnitude but also the trajectory of change in rice production across different regions.

#### Data Visualization
We utilize bar charts, pie charts, and line plots to comprehensively analyze state-wise production variations over the years.

### ARIMA Model
#### Preprocessing
We ensure the reliability of our analysis by prioritizing the attainment of stationarity within the time series data.

#### Model Selection
We employ the ARIMA model and conduct hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best possible fit to the data.

#### Training and Evaluation
We train the ARIMA model using historical data and subject it to rigorous evaluation using metrics such as MAE and RMSE.

#### Prediction
We make predictions for the next five years using the trained ARIMA model.

### LSTM Model
#### Data Preparation
We transform the dataset into sequences of fixed length to prepare it for training the LSTM model.

#### Model Architecture
We carefully design an LSTM architecture considering factors such as the number of layers, units, and dropout rates.

#### Training and Validation
We train the LSTM model using historical data and validate its performance on a separate test set.

#### Prediction
We make predictions for the next five years using the trained LSTM model.

## Comparative Analysis
We conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the ARIMA and LSTM models for forecasting state-wise rice production.

## Conclusion
Our proposed approach aims to provide accurate forecasts for agricultural planning and decision-making, contributing to improving rice production strategies and addressing challenges in agricultural sustainability.

# Developing a Multimodal Model for Detecting Harmful Internet Memes using CLIP + CNET Architecture

## Introduction
The proliferation of internet memes, often combining images and text, has become a significant cultural phenomenon. In this proposal, we outline our approach to develop a novel multimodal machine learning model for classifying harmful internet memes using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model in conjunction with a custom convolutional neural network (CNet) architecture.

## Dataset Description
We utilize the "BrainDead Multimodal Data for Hateful Meme" dataset provided for the competition, consisting of 10,000 data points, each representing an internet meme.

## Proposed Approach
We outline our approach, including preprocessing, CLIP model integration, CNet architecture design, fusion, and classification.

## Comparative Analysis
We compare the performance of our proposed model with similar datasets A and B, utilizing performance metrics and insights gained from the comparison.

## Conclusion
Our proposed multimodal model aims to achieve superior performance compared to existing benchmark models while minimizing computation power requirements, contributing to the advancement of meme moderation systems.
